///
/// Owns the state machine and nothing else. Features plug in as a
/// `TranscriptProcessor` (after transcription, before delivery) or a
/// `DictationObserver` (reacting to the loop), not as branches here.
///
/// Edge cases, kept exactly as the loop behaved before this type existed:
/// - A press always tries to start capture, even while an earlier capture is
///   still transcribing. That transcription still delivers, and its
///   `dictationFinished` reaches observers while the new recording runs.
/// - A press whose capture fails to start logs and notifies `dictationFailed`
///   with the capture error; the state does not change.
/// - A release always stops capture and notifies `dictationTranscribing`,
///   even with nothing recorded; an empty capture then fails with
///   `DictationError.noAudio`.
/// - A transcript that does not reach the cursor (a secure field, or focus
///   moved since the press) fails with its `DeliveryError`.
