# Builds the release binary and wraps it in a signed ParrotLock.app.
#   scripts/build-app.sh [version]        → build/ParrotLock.app
#
# The version (a tag such as v0.1.0 or 0.1.0) goes into
# CFBundleShortVersionString and CFBundleVersion. Without one it comes from
# the latest tag, or 0.0.0.
#
# Embeds Sparkle.framework (in-app updates, #50) in Contents/Frameworks and
# signs it inside-out before the app: its XPC services, Autoupdate, and
# Updater.app, then the framework, all with the same identity and the
# hardened runtime, as notarization requires.
#
# Signs with the first "Developer ID Application" identity in the keychain,
# with the hardened runtime and packaging/Parrot.entitlements. The
# designated requirement then names the bundle ID and the team, not a
# cdhash, so macOS keeps the Microphone and Accessibility grants across
# builds. Without an identity the app is ad-hoc signed and every build is a
# new identity; the script says so.
#
#   PARROT_SIGN_IDENTITY   signing identity (default: the keychain's Developer ID)
#   PARROT_TIMESTAMP=none  skip the secure timestamp (local builds, offline);
#                          notarization needs it, so releases leave this unset
#   PARROT_BUILD_DIR       output directory (default: build)
